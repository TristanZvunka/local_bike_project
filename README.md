Welcome to my first public DBT repository!

Created as part of my Analytics Engineer training powered by DataBird, this project aims to showcase my working method on dbt.

I am new to this tool, so any constructive feedback and suggestions are welcome! :)

Context:
Alexander Anthony, founder of Local Bike, spent a decade as a professional cyclist, competing in major international events, including the Tour de France. However, it wasn’t just the adrenaline of the races that left a lasting impression. During his training in Europe, Alexander discovered cities where cycling was not just a leisure activity but an integral part of urban living. Upon returning to the United States, he noticed a significant lack of infrastructure and cycling culture in major metropolitan areas.
